        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <p>
          In the beginning, the travel agency business was in a state of
          experimentation and community help. Gradually, the business grew up in
          such a scale that competitive travel companies around the world forged
          into the sophisticated business. The nature of the business was a sort
          of intermediary role to cater holiday related services to those who
          were away from home. Travel agencies made all possible efforts to
          ensure the service quality for enhancing the level of satisfaction. In
          practice, travel agencies were principally driven by the needs of the
          customers.

        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>
          Our mission is to, improve the way people seek and discover travel
          information.
        </p>
        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p>
          Our vision is to search out the best price for the consumer. Consumers
          believe that product as are homogeneous and it is only price which
          matters which may not always be the case. This leads to price war
          amongst travel providers to maintain market share and fill capacity.
